Steps for getting a usable glyph out of SolveSpace and into FontForge:
1. For each layer in clock.slvs: select the layer, then export it as an SVG.
2. Combine the exported SVGs into clock.svg, aligning by the L-shaped datum marks in the center. Delete the datum marks.
3. Fix the paths: SolveSpace creates open paths with a start and end node. Using the node editor, for each path, find the start and end nodes and join them.
4. Replace the stroke with fill and create a bounding rectangle around the shape. Scale its height by 10/8ths, since the ascender is 800 of 1000 units. Scale the document to this size and delete the rectangle.
5. Import the resulting SVG into a new glyph in FontForge, with the "Scale to fit" option selected.
